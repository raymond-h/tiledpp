# Tiled++

Old C++ library for loading Tiled maps, made 5 years ago as of today.
You should probably be wary of actually using it, I have not checked
if there was anything missing or not.

## Build
```sh
make
```

Makefile only supports building a static library.

## Create ZIP of distributable files
```sh
make dist
```
